        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Suyuk, or bossam, is a traditional Korean pork dish starring flavorful, melt-in-your mouth boiled pork. The main flavor component of this recipe is a Korean paste called doenjang paste, which translates to fermented soybean paste. The paste gives the pork a deep, rich, salty flavor and it'll bring the dish closer to how it's traditionally made. This recipe might take some time to make, but following these simple steps will make the wait absolutely worth it!</p>
